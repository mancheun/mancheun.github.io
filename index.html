          <p>
            This preprint studies  <em>recurrence equations</em> (also called <em>difference equations</em>) of order 3.
            You've seen recurrences before:
            the Fibonacci numbers \(F_0,F_1,F_2\dots\) satisfies the recurrence relation 
            \[F_{n+2}=F_{n+1}+F_{n}\text{ for }n\ge 0,\quad F_0=0,\quad F_1=1.\]
            Thus
            $$\begin{align*}
            && F_2&=F_1+F_0=1+0=1,\\
            && F_3&=F_2+F_1=1+1=2,\\
            && F_4&=F_3+F_2=2+1=3,\\
            && F_5&=F_4+F_3=3+2=5,\\
            && F_6&=F_5+F_4=5+3=8,\\
            && &\;\;\vdots\\
            \end{align*}$$
          </p>
          <p>
            To understand the Fibonacci sequence, it is better to study the terms of the sequence all at once: we define the <em>left shift operator</em> \(\Phi\) to take a sequence \((s_0,s_1,s_2,\dots)\) to the sequence \((s_1,s_2,s_3,\dots)\). The Fibonacci sequence is then a solution to the operator \(\Phi^2-\Phi-1\), since
            \[\begin{align*}
            (\Phi^2-\Phi-1)(F_n)&=\Phi^2(F_n)-\Phi(F_n)-(F_n)\\
            &=(F_{n+2})-(F_{n+1})-(F_{n})=(0).
            \end{align*}\]
          </p>
          <h3>Linear recurrence operators</h3>
          <p>
            Analogous to <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation">differential equations</a></em>, the solutions of a recurrence operator within the set of sequences of complex numbers is a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space">vector space</a></em> over \(\mathbb{C}\) (the field of complex numbers). Moreover, the dimension of this vector space equals the order of the recurrence operator. Here, the <em>order</em> of a recurrence operator 
            \[\Phi^n+f_{n-1}\Phi^{n-1}+\cdots+f_1\Phi+f_0,\quad f_0\neq 0\]
            is defined to be \(n\).
          </p>
          <p>
            For any \(\lambda\in \mathbb{C}\), the exponential sequence \((1,\lambda,\lambda^2,\lambda^3,\dots)\) is an <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors">eigenvector</a></em> for the left shift operator \(\Phi\), since 
            \[\Phi(1,\lambda,\lambda^2,\lambda^3,\dots)=(\lambda,\lambda^2,\lambda^3,\lambda^4,\dots)=\lambda\cdot (1,\lambda,\lambda^2,\lambda^3,\dots).\]
            By plugging the exponential sequence into \(\Phi^2-\Phi-1=0\), we see that a basis of solutions for \(\Phi^2-\Phi-1=0\) is given by
            \[(\lambda_{\pm}^{n})_{n=0}^{\infty},\quad\text{where}\quad\lambda_{\pm}=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{5}}{2}.\]
            Since the Fibonacci sequence is also a solution of \(\Phi^2-\Phi-1=0\), we find that 
            \[
              F_n = c_-(\lambda_-)^n+c_+ (\lambda_+)^n\quad\text{for all }n\ge 0
            \]
            and for some constants \(c_-,c_+\in \mathbb{C}\). Letting \(n=0\) and \(n=1\) and solving for \(c_\pm\) gives \(c_\pm=\pm 1/\sqrt{5}\). This gives an explicit formula for the Fibonacci sequence (called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence#Binet's_formula">Binet's formula</a></em>).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the same way, we can fully understand the solutions to recurrence operators
            \[\Phi^n+f_{n-1}\Phi^{n-1}+\cdots+f_1\Phi+f_0,\quad f_0\neq 0\]
            where the \(f_i\) are complex numbers.
          </p>
          <h3>Linear recurrence operators of order 3</h3>
          <p>
            The next challenge is to understand the solutions to such recurrence operators when the \(f_i\) are rational functions in \(n\). These operators arise naturally. For instance, the factorial sequence \((n!)=(0!,1!,2!,\dots)\) satisfies the operator \(\Phi-(n+1)\).
          </p>
          <p>
            The work in this preprint shows that when the recurrence operator is of order 3, and when the solutions of this operator always arise from combining solutions of lower order operators by \(+\), \(\times\), \(\Phi\), \(\Phi^{-1}\), and interlacing, then this operator is classified into the following three cases:
            <ul>
              <li>The recurrence operator can be (nontrivially) factored into operators of lower orders.</li>
              <li>Up to gauge transformation, the recurrence operator has the form \(\Phi^3+f\).</li>
              <li>Up to gauge transformation, the recurrence operator has a basis of solutions of the form \(rs^2,rst,rt^2\), where \(r\) satisfies a linear recurrence operator of order 1, and \(s,t\) is a basis of solutions for a linear recurrence operator of order 2.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, <em>interlacing</em> means taking finitely many sequences like \((r_0,r_1,r_2,\dots)\), \((s_0,s_1,s_2,\dots)\), \((t_0,t_1,t_2,\dots)\), and forming the new sequence
            \[(r_0,s_0,t_0,r_1,s_1,t_1,r_2,s_2,t_2,\dots)\]
            which splices the individual sequences together.

            The motivation that kickstarted this project was the desire to <q>glue</q> the following two papers together:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Peter Hendriks and Michael Singer, <i>Solving difference equations in finite terms</i>, Journal of Symbolic Computation (1999).

              <li>
                Michael Singer, <i>Solving homogeneous linear differential equations in terms of second order linear differential equations</i>, American Journal of Mathematics (1985).
              </li>
            </ul>

            The <q>glue</q> that binds these two papers together is the use of representation theory applied directly to difference modules.

          <p>
            This paper contains my thesis work about how <em>little</em> we can simplify a general linear differential equation by certain simple operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            You learned how to simplify polynomials in school. The substitution \(x=y-a/2\) completes the square in
            \[x^2+ax+b\]
            to give
            \[y^2+(b+a^2/4).\]
            While the original polynomial depends on two parameters \(a\) and \(b\), the <q>simplified</q> polynomial \(y^2+c\) depends on only one parameter \(c=b+a^2/4\).
          </p>
          <p>
            More generally, the translation \(x=y-a/n\) simplifies the general polynomial 
            \[x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x_1+a_0\]
            to a polynomial 
            \[y^n+0\cdot y^{n-1}+b_{n-2}y^{n-2}+\cdots+b_1y_1+b_0\]
            which relies on the \(n-1\) parameters \(b_0,b_1,\dots,b_{n-2}\).
          </p>
          <p>
            There's an analogue for this with differential equations. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Recall that a basic operation of calculus is measuring the slope of a function \(f(t)\) through its <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative">derivative</a></em> \(f'(t)\). If \(t\) represents time, the slope \(f'(t)\) of \(f(t)\) describes how \(f(t)\) changes with time. It's no surprise then that <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation">differential equations</a></em>—the equations involving these derivatives, and derivatives of derivatives, and so on—models our changing world, like how much time it takes a projectile to land, or the concentration of a chemical compound in a chemical reaction at a given time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it turns out, the first differential equations you often meet in a <em>differential equations course</em> can be simplified by an analogue of translation: the transformation
            \[y=\exp(-\frac{1}{n}\int f_{n-1}\,dx)\cdot z\]
            gets rid of the coefficient \(f_{n-1}\) in the general differential equation
            \[y^{(n)}+f_{n-1}y^{(n-1)}+\dots+f_{1}y'+f_{0}y=0.\]
          </p>
          <p>
            My PhD thesis then gives an <em>impossibility result</em>: 
            this general differential equation cannot be simplified to fewer parameters by using simple transformations (the <em>gauge transformations</em>), whose coefficients are rational functions in the \(f_{i}^{(j)}\) and don't involve integrals. In hindsight, this is perhaps why you learn about these <q>integrating factors</q> \(\exp(\int f\,dx)\) in differential equations class. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My work should remind you of another impossibility statement—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem">insolvability of the general quintic polynomial by radicals</a>, proved via <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory">Galois theory</a></em>. Indeed, my thesis uses a differential version of Galois theory. To additionally keep track of the number of coefficients that simplify away in our differential equations, I adapt the theory of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_dimension">essential dimension</a></em> which already does this but for polynomials. Using both <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_Galois_theory">differential Galois theory</a></em> and the notion of <em>differential essential dimension</em> allow me to prove my result.
          </p>
